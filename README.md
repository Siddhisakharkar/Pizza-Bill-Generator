# Description

1. Platform: IntelliJ IDEA (a popular integrated development environment for Java development)
2. Language: Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) - a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to create robust and maintainable software systems
3. Functionality: The pizza bill generator is a Java-based application that calculates the total bill for a pizza order based on user input (e.g., pizza type, toppings, crust type, etc.). It uses Java OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism to model the pizza ordering process.
4. Features: The application allows users to select from various pizza options, add toppings, and calculate the total bill. It also displays the bill details, including the pizza name, toppings, and total cost. The generator uses Java's built-in data types and operators to perform calculations and manipulate data.
